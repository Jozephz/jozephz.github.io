       <ul>
      <li><strong>You can’t directly see a black hole</strong> - Because a black hole is indeed “black” — no light can escape from it, it’s impossible for us to sense the hole directly</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Black holes come in a range of sizes</strong> - There are at least three types of black holes, NASA says, ranging from relative squeakers to those that dominate a galaxy’s center.
      </li>
         <li>
        <strong>Look out! Our Milky Way likely has a black hole</strong> - There is probably a huge supermassive black hole lurking in the middle of our galaxy. Luckily, we’re nowhere near this monster — we are about two-thirds of the way out from the center, relative to the rest of our galaxy.
      </li>
         <li>
        <strong>Weird time stuff happens around black holes</strong> - When you’re at extreme speeds close to light. The black hole warps time and space so much that Unlucky’s time appears to be running slower.
      </li>
         <li>
        <strong>Black holes are only dangerous if you get too close</strong> - Like creatures behind a cage, it’s okay to observe a black hole if you stay away from its event horizon, this zone is the point of no return, when you’re too close for any hope of rescue.
